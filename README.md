# LeetCode-Solution-Well-Formed

## Item Rename Description

+ Renamed "Well-Formed" means "well-formed". I always think that the readability of the code is very important. The premise of readable code is "well-formed". In Intellij Idea, PyCharm, and CLion, the shortcut key I use most is `⌥ + ⌘ + L` ), I hope that the friends who see this project will be well-formatted and easy for others to read, even if it is a purely "self-entertainment" project.

** Supplementary Note **: I have a limited level of English and can't think of a better name. If you have a better idea, please let me know. I have been worrying about the name.

+ Added Java and C ++ language code.

## project instruction

+ This code warehouse is an exercise I did on [LeetCode (Chinese version)] (https://leetcode-cn.com/) when I was studying Algorithms and Data Structures. It started with Python code, and then added Java code and C ++ code. Java is my entry language for programming, Python is a language that I will learn after learning artificial intelligence, and C ++ is only used to solve problems, because I have the basics of Java and learn as I write.

+ All codes are tested by [LeetCode (Chinese version)] (https://leetcode-cn.com/) online evaluation system, at least the correct code, but my level is limited, the code is for reference only, welcome You communicate with me.

+ We recommend that you install [Octotree Plugin] (https://www.octotree.io/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=extension) for the best reading experience.

## Coding basis

In the process of writing the code, I pay more attention to the following places:

1.Good format

2.Follow code specifications

The code specifications and tools I follow are:

Programming Language | Code Specification | Tools |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- -------------------- | ----------------------------- ------------------------------- |
Java | [Alibaba Java Development Manual] (https://github.com/alibaba/p3c) | [Alibaba Java Coding Guidelines] (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10046-alibaba-java-coding -guidelines /) |
Python | [PEP 8-Style Guide for Python Code] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) | [autopep8] (https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8 ), [Black] (https://github.com/psf/black) |
C ++ | [Google Style Guides] (https://github.com/google/styleguide), [Google Open Source Project Style Guide (Chinese version)] (https://zh-google-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/ latest /) | |

personal suggestion:

(1) The observance of coding standards is in accordance with the "nearby principle". If the programmer's team specifies a coding specification, the internal code specification of the team takes precedence;

(2) Adhering to well-formed and coding specifications is a very tedious thing. We can help us with the help of tools by installing the above-mentioned plugins in the IDE. These plugins will prompt the coding irregularities and give suggestions for modification. Can help programmers develop good coding habits.

3. Use an integrated development environment

Use the IDE tool developed by jetbrains. Plugins mainly for using code formatting and scanning encoding specifications

+ Java: Intellij Idea (Ultimate)
+ Python: PyCharm (Ultimate)
+ C ++: CLion, Visual Studio Code (open source)

## Learning Resources

My personal learning resources are as follows, ** for your reference only **.

Books

+ "Algorithm 4": A book with a high value, written in Java, with clear examples and elegant pictures. Very suitable for novice learning. The disadvantages are: lack of translation, some code is encapsulated, it is confusing to read, and the sample code given is not standardized.

+ "Introduction to Algorithms": As a reference book study, the "Dynamic Programming", "Greedy Algorithm", "Count Sort", "Cardinal Sort", "Cycle Invariant", and "KMP" algorithms are explained in detail. The disadvantage is that it is too academic and not suitable for introductory tutorials on algorithms and data structures.

2. Online lessons and self-media

+ A class of network teacher liuyubobobo's algorithm and data structure courses. I myself learned the pitfall algorithm and data structure of Teacher Liu's course. (Mr. Liu's course is carefully prepared and it is charged. Please judge for yourself whether you need to buy it.)
+ You can search for some excellent self-media on Bilibili and youtub. Listening to their topics is also a very good way to learn. The self-media I often watch are: flower sauce, programmer knife, one two three four five, lee215215, Hu Xiaoxu -_-, there are pits under your feet, and the code can speak.

3.Excellent blog and public account

+ In 2018, a project to produce algorithmic animations and a public account went viral, which was refreshing. The name of the public account is "Five Minutes Learning Algorithm" and the blogger is called "Programmer Brother Wu". I have learned a lot on this public account. My current blog template is also based on the template used by Brother Wu. modify. Brother Wu, a programmer, can be found on many platforms, and everyone is welcome to follow.

4. Join a learning team and find one or two friends, you will not be alone in solving the problem

I am fortunate to join a QQ group (group number: 812791932). If the problem is more irritating, I can come to the group to chat with you and brag about it. Of course, ask questions in the group, there will be big bosses, giants answer you.

## Brush suggestion

There is nothing very special, but I did learn in the following way. (For reference only, I am just a beginner.)

1. Study first, do some questions after having some preliminary knowledge

It is normal for some algorithm problems not to be solved, that is because their knowledge reserves are not enough. So either read a book or watch a video to learn, or study this problem that will not be done as a knowledge point. I thought it was okay to copy the code at the beginning. After copying the code, I would delete it and write it a few times.

If you really think of a problem that you can't think of for a long time, look at the solution and other people's videos to learn.

2. Do a few more times, try to summarize and classify

A question, especially a classic one, should be tried several times and summarized. The thinking of some problems is universal, and the skills are relatively fixed, which requires constant practice to consolidate and experience.

3. Try multiple solutions and don't ignore violent solutions

More than one problem is sometimes equivalent to doing it several times. The "violent solution" is usually the basis of advanced solutions. It is usually natural to start with the "violent solution" to analyze the shortcomings, and then improve and optimize it to understand the solution to this problem.

4. Try to output and share

The relatively lacking abilities of many programmers (including myself) are language and written expression. The output is a better way to exercise yourself. Writing blogs and writing solutions can help others, help you organize your ideas, and make friends.

After I wrote the solution, many friends gave suggestions and pointed out mistakes, which benefited me a lot. Some friends have added me to WeChat and QQ. I am very happy to communicate with them and become friends.

5. Participate in competitions and practice your hands

The previous questions may be like after-school exercises. If you do n’t do it, there will be so many. You can also see the answers. There is no motivation to do it. If you want to simulate the feeling of interviews and written tests, you can participate in the competition.

I have begun to participate in the weekly and bi-weekly games of "Likou" in the last two months. At the beginning, because there were some things that could not be separated, I just played a card and didn't do a question. Basically two to three questions can still be done now. After the puzzle, you will learn and make a note.

Participating in competitions is a great way to learn, develop your ability to think independently, and interact with others.

> I hope that all of our programmers can achieve their ideals through their own efforts.
>
> Hope that our programmers are no longer stereotypes in the eyes of others, we are also artists.
>
> I hope that we can all achieve success in our work areas. Glad to be friends with everyone.
